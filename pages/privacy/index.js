            <h5>Google Analytics</h5>
            <p>
              We use Google Analytics to collect information about your use of
              our website. Google Analytics collects information such as how
              often users visit the site, what pages they visit when they do so,
              and what other sites they used prior to coming to our website. We
              use the information we get from Google Analytics to improve our
              website and the user experience. Google Analytics collects only
              the IP address assigned to you on the date you visit our website,
              rather than your name or other identifying information. We do not
              combine the information collected through the use of Google
              Analytics with personally identifiable information. Google
              Analytics plants a permanent cookie on your web browser to
              identify you as a unique user the next time you visit our website.
              This cookie cannot be used by anyone other than Google. Googleâ€™s
              ability to use and share information collected by Google Analytics
              about your visits to our website is restricted by the Google
              Analytics Terms of Use and the Google Privacy Policy.

              fulfill the purposes for which it was collected, unless a longer
              retention period is required by law. We take reasonable measures
              to protect the information we collect from loss, theft, misuse,
              and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction.
